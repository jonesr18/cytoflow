Setting up to use CytoFlow (Windows, Python 2.7)

Step 1: Aquire Anaconda 2.2.0 Python Distribution

As my python core, I use Anaconda [1]. From the site:

"Anaconda is a completely free Python distribution (including for commercial use and redistribution).
It includes over 195 of the most popular Python packages for science, math, engineering, data analysis."

It really has has virtually every package you'll need for scientific analysis, including pandas, SciPy, and NumPy.

Step 2: Get Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7

This is needed for the traits package. You can find it here [2].

Step 3: Acquire Remaining Dependencies with pip

pip is a command-line program used to reliably find and install python packages.
To use it, open your command line in Administrative mode and type "pip". 
The program will list functions you can use to peruse, update, and add packages. 

To install a package, simply type "pip install <package name>" (don't actually add <these>)
You will need the following packages:

envisage
traits
flowcytometrytools
seaborn

And after that you should be able to successfully run cytoflow!
