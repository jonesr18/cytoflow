1. Data Import

// Update: 
I found that you can simultaneously add data to multiple cells at a time - nice, that makes it much easier.
We should be able to delete a column that is no longer desirable.

...

I think that the experiment setup tool is great, but a little clunky. Ideally, I could make an excel file
(which many people might already do when planning) with the experimental setup using the same layout,
then import it directly. That would be much easier for the user, since excel is easier to work with.

That said, making sure that data is in the right format and so forth would be much more difficult. 
Maybe create a template? 

Example:

BEGINDATA // The first cell has a key to tell the program where to look for the experimental layout
Source	Tube	Parameter1	Parameter2	...		ParameterN	
Type	#		True/False	Number		...		Number (log)
Control	A1		True		100			...		5
Control A2		False		0			... 	0 
Sample	B1		True		200			... 	4
...		...		...			...			...		...
ENDDATA

And so on. You could even make a template that has to be copied into, with nothing else in it to
make importing data less confusing.
